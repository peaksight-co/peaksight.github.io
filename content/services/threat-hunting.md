Threat Hunting is the process of proactively identifying and mitigating potential cyber threats before they can cause damage to your network infrastructure. As a startup specializing in information security, Peaksight provides Threat Hunting as a Service (THaaS) to help businesses protect their users and digital assets.


## What is Threat Hunting?
Threat Hunting is a proactive security approach that involves analyzing network traffic, system logs, and other data sources to identify potential threats that traditional security measures might miss. Threat Hunting requires a deep understanding of threat actors' behavior, tactics, and techniques to identify and mitigate threats before they can cause harm.
