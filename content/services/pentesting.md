## What is Penetration Testing?
Penetration Testing is a process of identifying vulnerabilities in a network infrastructure, applications, and systems that could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or compromise data. Penetration Testing involves simulating real-world attacks to determine the level of security a system can withstand and identifying any vulnerabilities that need to be remediated.
